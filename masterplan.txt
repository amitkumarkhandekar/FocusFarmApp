📘 masterplan.md — FocusFarm
1. App Overview & Objectives

FocusFarm is a mobile productivity app for students that helps them build consistent study habits through a playful, game-like farming experience.

Instead of growing trees (like Forest), users rear animals by completing focus goals. Over time, they build an infinite farm that visually represents their discipline, effort, and progress.

Primary Objectives

Make studying feel fun and emotionally rewarding

Encourage daily consistency without guilt or punishment

Provide a strong solo experience first, with a clear path to social features

Offer a student-friendly monetization model without paywalls

2. Target Audience
Primary (MVP)

School, college, and competitive exam students

Age: ~15–25

Study-heavy routines, often alone

Motivated by:

Visual progress

Emotional feedback

Light gamification

Secondary (Future)

College groups

Online study communities

Young professionals (with UI tweaks)

3. Core Product Philosophy

Kind, not strict — missed goals don’t punish harshly

Playful, not childish — game-like but respectful

Commitment-based — users promise time to themselves

Progress > perfection

Designed from day one for future social expansion

4. Core Features & Functionality
4.1 Focus Sessions

User-defined (flexible duration)

Pause allowed

Session continues even if app is closed

Other apps are blocked during an active session

Session must be manually stopped inside FocusFarm

Intent:
Create a focused “study mode” that feels serious but fair.

4.2 Goal System (Tier-Based)

Users work through tier-based goals:

Daily

Weekly

Monthly

Each tier represents increasing commitment and unlocks rewards.

Why tiers work well:

Clear progression

Game-like structure

Avoids overwhelm

Encourages realistic expectations for students

4.3 Animal-Based Reward System

Animals are unlocked by completing goal tiers

No evolution in MVP (distinct animals only)

Initial animals:

Hen

Goat

Cow

Each unlocked animal is added permanently to the user’s farm

Farm size is infinite

Emotional loop:

“My studying built this.”

4.4 Farm View

Visual representation of progress

Animals accumulate over time

Calm but playful animations

Serves as a long-term motivation anchor

5. Monetization Strategy
Model: Free Core + Cosmetic Premium

Always free:

Focus sessions

Goal tracking

Animal unlocking

Farm growth

Premium (cosmetic only):

Animal skins

Farm / land themes

Visual customizations

(Future) social badges or aura effects

Principle:

Never charge users for being productive.

6. Platform Strategy
MVP

Mobile-first

iOS + Android

Reasoning

Students primarily study with phones nearby

Blocking distractions is mobile-native

Social features fit naturally on mobile

7. Authentication & Data Strategy (Conceptual)

Mandatory login

Cloud-backed data storage (Supabase)

Enables:

Cross-device sync

Data safety

Future social mechanics (friends, rooms, shared rewards)

UX principle:
Login should feel lightweight and justified by value.

8. High-Level Technical Stack (Conceptual)

No implementation details — just direction.

Backend

Managed backend with authentication + database

Real-time capable (for future social features)

Recommended direction: Supabase
Why: Simple, scalable, social-ready, low overhead

Data Considerations

User profiles

Focus session logs

Goal progress

Animal inventory

Designed as if social is coming, even if unused in MVP.
